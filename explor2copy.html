          <p class='description'>Lamborghini created the Aventador SVJ to embrace challenges head-on, combining
            cutting-edge technology with extraordinary design, while always refusing to compromise. In a future driven
            by technology, it’s easy to lose the genuine thrill of driving. But in the future shaped by Lamborghini,
            this won’t be left behind, because there will always be a driver behind the wheel. </p>

          <p class='description'> Lamborghini maintains an active presence in motorsports through its Squadra Corse
            division. This specialized unit lets Lamborghini retain total control of all engineering and production
            processes, allowing it to provide its motorsport customers with vehicles whose superior quality has been
            underlined by countless racing victories across the globe. On the one hand, you have thoroughbred racecars
            like the Huracan Evo GT3 and the Super Trofeo supercars that regularly participate in competitive racing.
            Then, on the other hand, there are custom-made track weapons like the Essenza SCV12 that are too extreme for
            regulated racing and can only be used for private track sessions... </p>

          <p class='description'> The Limited Series Lamborghini cars are the rarest, most exclusive creations from the
            House of the Raging Bull. They are typically designed for only a select number of clients. They form what
            Lamborghini now calls the “Few-Off” initiative, similar to the Ferrari Special Projects program that is all
            about creating bespoke models in very limited numbers. The cars are often equipped with some of the most
            advanced features available in the fields of automotive design and technology. The Sian FKP 37 and FKP 37
            Roadsters finished their final deliveries in early 2023, and the Countach LPi800-4 will finish deliveries in
            early 2024. There were no Special Editions announced for 2024... </p>

          <p class='description'>
            The Huracan received a major rollback in available models in 2023, moving from having six versions of the
            EVO to just one, the EVO Spyder. The Huracan STO remains unchanged from the 2023 car for 2024, while two new
            models, the off-road oriented, limited edition Sterrato , and the Tecnica, which is an evolution of the EVO
            as well as having a track-oriented setup like the STO. The Tecnica is positioned as the start of the last
            iteration of the Huracan, with a Spyder model rumored to be on the way, as well as is the last Huracan trim
            planned that does not include a performance hybrid powertrain.

            The Revuelto is Lamborghini's new flagship V12 supercar, replacing the venerable Avendator. The Revuelto is
            the first non-limited series Lamborghini to offer a full performance hybrid powertrain, to the point that it
            reaches hypercar levels of power at 1,001 HP with the first introductory model. The 6.5L V12 also now
            redlines at close to 9,500, and is supported by an independent electrical motor on each of the two front
            wheels, and one in the 8-speed transaxle that acts as a torque fill and power boost during shifting and
            launches, respectively.

          <p class='description'> Lamborghini proved it was open to change and new ideas when it introduced the Urus for
            the 2018 model year. So far, it’s a gamble that’s paid off big time The Urus remains Lamborghini’s
            best-selling vehicle and accounted for almost 60% of 2021 total sales. It offers best-in-class driving
            dynamics and is easily one of the best performance SUVs on the market today.. </p>
